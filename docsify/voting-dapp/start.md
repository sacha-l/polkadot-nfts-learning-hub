# Build a Voting Dapp tutorial (part 1)

Welcome to the Polkadot voting dApp tutorial. Youâ€™ll learn how to build a dApp in the ink! programming language using OpenBrush, write tests for it and interact with it using a front-end. This tutorial is based on the OpenBrush Substrate Seminars (full videos here and here) which is recommended material to watch before diving into this tutorial.

The voting app youâ€™ll be building is for educational purposes and is not meant to be shipped to production. However youâ€™ll learn the basics of creating a dApp that implements staking and voting logic for a simple application that allows users to vote and propose items to be voted on. Itâ€™s meant to be fun, educational and somewhat applicable to a real world use case.ðŸ˜Š

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you:

- Know basic Rust
- Have completed the [beginnerâ€™s ink! tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/)
- Have a wallet chrome extension to sign transactions
- Have a test account wallet funded with ROC tokens. [Learn how to get some here if you havenâ€™t already](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#obtaining-roc).
- Have the latest cargo +nightly installed: see [https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/issues/1058#issuecomment-1501225760](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/issues/1058#issuecomment-1501225760)

## Tools

The tools youâ€™ll be exploring in this tutorial are: 

- ink! - a DSL for writing Wasm smart contracts for Substrate chains.
- OpenBrush - a framework for developing dapps.
- The Contracts parachain on Rococo - the live testnet.
- Contracts UI - a UI to easily deploy contracts to Rococo.
