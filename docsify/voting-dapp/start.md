**Topics**: ink!, OpenBrush, Governance

Welcome to the Polkadot voting dApp tutorial. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to build a dApp in the [ink! programming language](https://use.ink/) using [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/) - an ink! smart contract library. You'll also learn how to write tests for it and interact with it using a front-end. This tutorial is based on the [Substrate Seminar](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/resources/seminar/) introducing [BrushFam](https://brushfam.io/) (see the full video below) which is recommended material to watch before diving into this tutorial.

The voting app youâ€™ll be building is for educational purposes and is not meant to be shipped to production. However youâ€™ll learn the basics of creating a multi-contract dApp that implements staking and voting logic for a simple application that allows users to vote and propose items to be voted on. **Itâ€™s meant to be fun, educational and somewhat applicable to a real world use case.** ðŸ˜Š

## What you'll learn

- Use and extend a PSP22 contract
- Implement Staking and Voting logic using OpenBrush's trait implementation pattern
- Create cross-contract calls

> **Note:** this tutorial is not designed for complete beginners. It is designed such that each part builds on top of one another.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the [beginnerâ€™s ink! tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/develop-a-smart-contract/) (this implies that you have Rust and Cargo Contract installed on your machine) 
- Know basic Rust
- Have a wallet chrome extension to sign transactions

## Tools

The tools youâ€™ll be exploring in this tutorial are: 

- [ink!](https://use.ink/) - a DSL for writing Wasm smart contracts for Substrate chains.
- [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/) - a smart contract library and framework for developing dapps.
- The [Contracts parachain](https://use.ink/testnet#what-is-the-contracts-parachain) on Rococo - a Polkadot-like live testnet.
- The [Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/) - a UI to easily deploy contracts to [Rococo](https://substrate.io/developers/rococo-network/).
